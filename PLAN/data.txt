LEXER

- initialize datas (create structs, save enp in a linkedlist)
- split input in tokens
- lexical errors checking

PARSER

- recognize token type and update linked list (t_token->type)
- heredoc managing (call a multiline input and merge it into a single line)
- syntatctical errors

EXPANDER

- expand all the values
- set redirection
- set pipeline if present

EXECUTER

- check for single command or pipeline
- create new process for non-builtins cmd
- wait for commands exit status (0 - 255)
- make exit status available for other processes or inspection (error handling and message)
- check for execution errors

typedef	struct s_data
{
	---pointer to linked_list of exit_codes ?
	---pointer to linked list for env (easy to print and modify)
	---pointer to tokens list
	---bool for pipeline
}				t_data;


typedef struct s_token
{
	char		*word;
	int 		type;
	t_token		*next;
}				t_token;


Execute command per command independently
heredoc >> all  (takes lead) + return error in parser (I think that it's better to return an error outside, separating concerns is important)

builtin recogniton
If a command specified to the shell contains a slash ``/'', the shell will not execute a builtin command
